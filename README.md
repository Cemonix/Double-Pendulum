# Double Pendulum Simulation

This project simulates the motion of a double pendulum using numerical methods in C with real-time visualization using Raylib. The simulation demonstrates the complex and chaotic behavior of a double pendulum system under the influence of gravity.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of a double pendulum.
- Numerical integration using the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.
- Interactive visualization with Raylib.

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 with C/C++ development tools installed.
- Raylib is included and configured within the project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cemonix/Double-Pendulum.git
   
2. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Build the project using Visual Studio's build tools.
4. Run the simulation from within Visual Studio.

## Usage

After running the simulation, a window will open displaying the double pendulum. The initial state of the pendulum can be modified in the source code to observe different behaviors.
